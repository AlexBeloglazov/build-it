##Description##
**What is it?**

Build-It website! With the help of this website you will be able to build pages with your voice. The user can not only build page but also save the work and continue working on it where he/she left.  Also can view the page, and edit the page.

**Who is our ideal user?**

This website is very user friendly, easy to use and people of any age having basic knowledge about computer can get the most out of it from this website. Also this website will encourage people to play around web pages and learn new stuff in web development.

**How will it benefit the user?**

It benefits the audience because user can develop the web page in couple minutes with different text, tags, and elements. Also people with non – tech background can use this website to develop their web pages following easy steps and guide available on the website. 


##How does is work?##
When the user lands on the home page, if he/she is not already signed in then can log in using the Facebook or Google login. Once you get logged in, you can add a new page by clicking on the page and get started or you can continue where you left.

Now you can see the speaker icon on the bottom left, click and you can speak what you want to add and remove from the page. User can add Text, Paragraph, Heading, Jumbotron, Footer, Navigation Bar, Button, font size, links and much more. Also if you want to see what you can do with the above elements, you can click on the element and see the pop up menu at the right corner to see what changes or how you can modify the elements.

**For example:**

User can say – “Add a paragraph”. This will add a paragraph to the page

Or, user can say - “Remove/delete a paragraph”. This will delete the paragraph from the page
        
When you are done, you can click on save and continue your work when you are willing to.


##Development##
**Frontend:**
The UI is made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

**Backend:**
The backend functionality is done with api.ai framework for voice recognition, NodeJs, Mongo database.

**Future Work:**
In future we will try to make this website be a web app, where users can do development with just one click of a button. Also we will keep updating the website adding new functionality to it where user can have more choices to make their web page look more attractive.
